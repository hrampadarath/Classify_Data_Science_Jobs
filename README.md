## Web Scraping Indeed and classifying Data Science Jobs


In this project, I will be looking into building a job classifier. This project has 4 main parts:

1. web scraping the Indeed website for data science job postings
2. bulid a classifier to classify the differnt data science types/levels
3. classify a real data scientist based upon skills, experience etc
4. provide a list of skills required for a data scientist to move one level up


The first part (web scraping) is based on the tutorial at https://github.com/aakashtandel/Web-Scraping-Indeed/blob/master/Code/Project%203%20-%20Web%20Scraping%20Indeed%20Job%20Listings%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb
